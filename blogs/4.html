                       <h3 >What is Masala Chai?</h3>
                       <p>
                         Masala chai is a creamy, spiced tea that’s most popular in India but is increasingly enjoyed around the world. The primary difference between chai and masala chai is that masala chai includes spices, while chai is simply tea and milk.

Chai is typically made with four components:
1. Black tea (we prefer bagged or loose-leaf, decaf when possible)
2. Milk (we went dairy-free with coconut and/or cashew )
3. Sweetener (we went for a little maple syrup)
4. pices (ginger, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, black pepper)

                         The spices vary depending on the recipe, but our favorite combination is cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, cloves, and ginger.

                           <h2>How to Make Chai Tea</h2>
                       <p>
                        Our inspired version begins by lightly crushing the spices in a mortar and pestle (or a cutting board and heavy pan will do!).

Slightly crushing the spices opens them up more and makes for a stronger infusion (so you get more flavor out of a lesser amount), packing more of a punch with fewer ingredients and less cost.

The crushed spices are added to a saucepan with water and freshly grated ginger and left to simmer for about 15 minutes. Grating the ginger makes for a stronger ginger flavor. But if gingery chai isn’t your thing, slice instead of grating and/or slightly reduce the amount.

We prefer steeping first in water alone because we find it makes a stronger infusion than adding the milk too soon.

The black tea and dairy-free milk are then added and heated slightly. For a full-bodied drink, we like using thick, rich dairy-free milks such as our Cashew Coconut Oat Milk.
