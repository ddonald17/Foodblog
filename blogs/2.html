                       <h3 >Origins of Naan</h3>
                       <p>
                        Naan is believed to date as far back as 1300 AD when it was mentioned in the notes of an Indo-Persian poet. Then, around 1526, it became popular among royals of the Mughal era in India. Because naan contained yeast (which was very expensive), it was reserved for royalty. (source)

How much times can change! Once yeast became more readily available, naan’s popularity spread throughout India and to other parts of the world.

                           <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Naan</h2>
                       <p>
                        Naan is traditionally made with all-purpose (wheat) flour, which is not gluten-free. But the gluten provides a stretchy element that can be tricky to replicate with gluten-free alternatives. But friends, we’ve done the trial and error so you don’t have to!

We’ve found that the key is to use a perfect combination of gluten-free flours that achieves the right taste and texture. You can read more about different gluten-free flours here.

For this recipe, we used coconut flour for its dense, wholesome texture then lightened it up with potato starch for fluffiness and arrowroot starch for a stretchy, pliable element.
